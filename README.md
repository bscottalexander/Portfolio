# Portfolio

My Motivation for this project is I wanted to showcase my projects and put a face to my name when applying for jobs in the future. This project makes it easy to show my work to potential employers and show my clear and easy to read coding style. I learned how to organize my code in an easy to read format that should impress employers. My project should stand out because it is coded in react, and is very neat. I plan to add to the Portfolio as I learn and create more projects.
